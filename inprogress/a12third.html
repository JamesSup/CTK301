				<h1>About me.</h1>
				<p class="me">My name is James. I am majoring in Creative Technologies at Illinois State University. I first started doing work in video editing in 2020. I started doing my own personal projects in open source video editing software. I eventually want to learn Adobe Premire Pro for better edits, along with learning Adobe After Effects. I learned a little bit about photo editing around the same time as video editing. So I want to get into Adobe Illustrator. I hope to get better and better at this craft. Feel free to contact me in the Contact page!</p>
